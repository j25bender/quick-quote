## Synopsis

Quick Quote is an application that supplies the user with quotes by category and provides them the opportunity to favorite.

## Motivation

I find it is important to draw wisdom from many sources and to have maxims to live by. This application provides the user the ability to access the vast resources of the TheySaidSo API to discover a new favorite quote to inspire and uplift or just 
for a laugh.
